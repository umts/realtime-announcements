# realtime-announcements
Automated announcements based on PVTA's realtime bus departure feed.

This is a Ruby script powered by a cron job which scans for departures leaving one or more stops within 5 minutes, and announces those departures.

Things I should come back to write about here:

+ Config file structure and what the defaults are
+ WAV file structure and what should be in each kind of file
+ How it all even works, maybe
